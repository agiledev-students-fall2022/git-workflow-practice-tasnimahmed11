## Is Software Development Saturated? [(link)](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/is-software-development-oversaturated#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20over%2017%2C000,more%20people%20qualify%20for%20roles.)

As copmuter science major, surrounded by many other CS majors I always thought that the software development/engineering market is very highly saturated, but this article indicates otherwise. The author highlights that as companies move further towards digilitalization, the need for coders in various development field also increases. It has been predicted that from 2020 to 2030, the employment of software engineers will grow by 22 percent, a rate that is faster than the average of all other occupations. Thus, the rate of employement growth indicates that even in the near future, the software development market won't be saturated, instead it will keep expanding with the advent of digitilization. 

### Alima's comment:
I find this article useful because we, as future software engineers, think about employment a lot. Knowing that market is not saturated and won't be in the next 10 years is very promising and relieving.
