## Is Software Development Saturated? [(link)](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/is-software-development-oversaturated#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20over%2017%2C000,more%20people%20qualify%20for%20roles.)

As copmuter science major, surrounded by many other CS majors I always thought that the software development/engineering market is very highly saturated, but this article indicates otherwise. The author highlights that as companies move further towards digilitalization, the need for coders in various development field also increases. It has been predicted that from 2020 to 2030, the employment of software engineers will grow by 22 percent, a rate that is faster than the average of all other occupations. Thus, the rate of employement growth indicates that even in the near future, the software development market won't be saturated, instead it will keep expanding with the advent of digitilization. 



*Maisha: With the advancement of technology and creation of metaverse and similar virtual spaces, we're moving forward to a further code generated environment, and this requires more and more programmers, not just for building, for managing, unit testing, enhancing security etc. This is why I believe although there is a lot of Software engineers in the market, it's not YET saturated, but there might be a time in the upcoming advancements of technology and scoiety where market might end up being saturated, but will mankind comeup with more technologies to work on at that time?*
